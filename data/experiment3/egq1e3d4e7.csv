You are invited to participate in a research study in cognitive psychology. You will be asked to perform various tasks on a computer which may include: looking at images or videos, listening to sounds, reading scenarios, or playing games. You may be asked a number of different questions about making judgments and intepreting people's actions. All information collected will remain confidential. </p> <p> <b>Risks and benefits:</b> Risks involved in this study are the same as those normally associated with using a computer (e.g., mild eye/arm strain). If you have any pre- existing conditions that might make reading and completing a computer-based survey strenuous for you, you should probably elect to not participate in this study. If at any time during the study you feel unable to participate because you are experiencing strain, you may end your participation without penalty. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment, medical care, and/or grades in school. </p><p><b>Time involvement:</b> Your participation in this experiment will take  5 minutes. </p><p><b> Payment:</b> If recruitment materials indicate payment (e.g., Prolific or other recruitment), you will receive compensation as indicated. </p><p><b>Subject's rights:</b> If you have read this notice and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. </p><p><b>Contact information:</b> If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research study, its procedures, or risks and benefits, you should ask the Protocol Director, (Professor Tobias Gerstenberg, Phone: (650) 725-2431; Email: gerstenberg@stanford.edu). </p><p><b>Independent contact:</b> If you are not satisfied with how this study is being conducted, or if you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to speak to someone independent of the research team via email at irb2-manager@lists.stanford.edu, or via phone at (650) 723-2480 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906.
