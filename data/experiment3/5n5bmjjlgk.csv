You are invited to participate in a research study in cognitive psychology. You will be asked to perform various tasks on a computer which may include: looking at images or videos, listening to sounds, reading scenarios, or playing games. You may be asked a number of different questions about making judgments and intepreting people's actions. All information collected will remain confidential. </p> <p> <b>Risks and benefits:</b> Risks involved in this study are the same as those normally associated with using a computer (e.g., mild eye/arm strain). If you have any pre- existing conditions that might make reading and completing a computer-based survey strenuous for you, you should probably elect to not participate in this study. If at any time during the study you feel unable to participate because you are experiencing strain, you may end your participation without penalty. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment, medical care, and/or grades in school. </p><p><b>Time involvement:</b> Your participation in this experiment will take  5 minutes. </p><p><b> Payment:</b> If recruitment materials indicate payment (e.g., Prolific or other recruitment), you will receive compensation as indicated. </p><p><b>Subject's rights:</b> If you have read this notice and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. </p><p><b>Contact information:</b> If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research study, its procedures, or risks and benefits, you should ask the Protocol Director, (Professor Tobias Gerstenberg, Phone: (650) 725-2431; Email: gerstenberg@stanford.edu). </p><p><b>Independent contact:</b> If you are not satisfied with how this study is being conducted, or if you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to speak to someone independent of the research team via email at irb2-manager@lists.stanford.edu, or via phone at (650) 723-2480 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906.

Anyway, since I'd never seen what the results actually were when a white cube was used, I just took a wild guess and guessed that maybe it was \""lighter\"" (I mean weight, not color, because somehow \""lighter\"" equals \""provides less horizontal movement\"" in my mind) than the other colors and so maybe this would be just enough for the cube not to make the line even with a yellow ramp.

But that's not really the point because these aren't actually literally ramps anyway and nobody actually said cubes were being launched off of them, and I think what they were ACTUALLY called was, like, blocks or something, but I'm kind of just calling them ramps here because their shape does resemble ramps and imagining the cubes being launched off of them makes the whole set of occurances here feel more natural and logical in my mind), but naturally the black cube would still be farther right and the red cube would still be farther left because that's how I assume it happened before, but I guess the point is in my mind I was thinking of it something like \""red cube equals +10 horizontal position, black cube equals +20, blue ramp = +50, yellow ramp = +70, white cube = presumed -20, white ramp = presumed -70\"" or whatever (It's not like I was thinking of it in terms of specific numbers or anything, but these are just some random numbers I made up to illustrate my point), with the point being that these numbers are absolute and just work in whatever direction they work regardless of anything else, e.g., a black cube always makes the cube end up farther to the right than a red cube even when the total direction of movement is to the left due to a white ramp because -70 + +20 is just greater than -70 + +10 even if both numbers ultimately are negative (and we're assuming in this case that higher numbers equals greater rightward movement in this case), but I suppose this doesn't HAVE to be the case, and an alternative way to think about this would be something like instead of thinking of the directions as positive and negative movement to just think of them as always being positive movement but just in different directions, and so maybe a yellow ramp could be +70 distance to the right and a white ramp could be +70 distance to the left, and maybe a red cube could add +10 to whatever distance it's thrown and a black cube could add +20, and so in this case a black cube would actually end up farther to the left when thrown left than a red cube and farther to the right when thrown right than a red cube, and this probably lines up closer to how real life physics works, because if I have something easy to throw and something hard to throw than the easier to throw object always ends up farther away from me regardless of whether I throw these objects east or west, but my point is just to say that that's just not how I was thinking of it (and to be fair, again, no one ever said that these cubes were necessarily being thrown per se) and I was thinking more in terms of each particular kind of cube and ramp having just a particular set value it adds to the cube's final position.""}","","generalization_check_survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","consistent","","red","left","","45","","","","","","",""

There were images where the ramps faced left? I don't remember that\"", but I'm just going to take my best guess here, and probably since the ramps are facing left now I figured the direction they'd launch the blocks would also be reversed, and since a yellow ramp launched a block farther right when facing right, I probably assumed it would launch it farther left when facing left, too. I don't have the other images available for comparison, so I can't be completly sure, but based on looks, I would guess that this is the relatively \""close\"" image with the cubes not that far from the ramps, and I would guess that there was probably another image where the cubes were farther away to the left, and if that's the case, then I would guess that my assumption was that since I assumed that white cubes went less far to the right when launched right, they might also go less far to the left when launched left, resulting in the final image we see here.""}","","generalization_check_survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","reversed","","yellow","left","","46","","","","","","",""
