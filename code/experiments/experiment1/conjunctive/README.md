# Readme

To run the experiment, click on the `index.html` file and then change the ending of URL in the browser to one of the following: 

- `index.html?condition=lc_lc`
- `index.html?condition=ds_ds`
- `index.html?condition=ds_dc`
- `index.html?condition=lc_dc`
- `index.html?condition=ds_ls`
- `index.html?condition=lc_ds`
- `index.html?condition=lc_ls`
- `index.html?condition=ds_lc`

The condition index indicates which object was a blicket, and which object was shown on the last trial. For example, `index.html?condition=lc_ds` means that the light cylinder was a blicket, and the dark square was shown on the last trial.

lc = light cylinder
ds = dark square
ls = light square
dc = dark cylinder
